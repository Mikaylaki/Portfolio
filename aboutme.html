<h1 style="color:grey;text-align:center;font-size:300%">About Me</h1>
<p style="color:powderblue;text-align:center;font-size:180%">Hello, My name is Mikayla King. I like to classify myself as a Pacific Northwestern Southern Belle. You see, I was born in sunny Atlanta, Georgia.My family and I moved to Seattle when I was around six. Now, I attend Holy Names Academy where I will be a Junior in the fall. Two things that I really care about are community service and diversity. I tutor a student twice a week through the Youth Tutoring Program with Catholic Community Services in addition to advocating for issues that I would like to see adressed in my community with 206 Forward. 206 Forward is a youth advocacy group that meets once a week to tal about the change that we would like to see, and how us teenagers can make it happen. Next year I will be both a Multicultural Student Union and Black Student Union leader. Welcome to my blog!</p>
