<h1 style="color:grey;text-align:center;font-size:300%">About Me</h1>
<p style="color:powderblue;text-align:center;font-size:180%">Hello, My name is Mikayla King. I like to classify myself as a Pacific Northwestern Southern Belle. You see, I was born in sunny Atlanta, Georgia.My family and I moved to Seattle when I was around six. Now, I attend Holy Names Academy where I will be a Junior in the fall. Two things that I really care about are community service and diversity. I tutor a student twice a week through the Youth Tutoring Program with Catholic Community Services in addition to advocating for issues that I would like to see adressed in my community with 206 Forward. 206 Forward is a youth advocacy group that meets once a week to tal about the change that we would like to see, and how us teenagers can make it happen. Next year I will be both a Multicultural Student Union and Black Student Union leader. Welcome to my blog!</p>

  <h3 style="color:grey;text-align:center;font-size:200%">Robotics Reflection</h3>

  <p style="color:powderblue;text-align:center;font-size:180%">After our discussion on what makes a robot a robot and what doesn't, my idea of what defines a robot didn't really change that much.However, our discussion did make me question just what properties define a robot. The properties that we discussed were not ones that I would've come up with on my own. What makes me excited about the future of robticcs is their expanded use. Before we know it, robots will be able to do just about everything for us! Although this is exciting, this is also what concerns me about the future of robotics. If we begin to rely on technology and robotics, then how will humans function on their own? What worked well today in the groups was our collaboration. We all got along together very well!Something that I can do better next time is stepping back and allowing the other people in my group to take charge and experiment!
